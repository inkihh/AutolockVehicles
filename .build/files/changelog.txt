[h2]Service Announcement[/h2]

I was made aware (thanks dan68rs) of the fact that the default value of proximity_unlock_distance_meters is 1, although in the documentation I was advising to not have a value lower than 2, because otherwise the unlock proximity trigger may not trigger.

If you were having trouble getting the proximity autolock feature to work, please check the value of this settings parameter in the config file $profile:AutolockVehicles/AutolockVehicles.json
